			<h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Yannan Tang (汤岩楠), Ph.D. in statistics from University of California, Irvine. My academic work focuses on statistical methodologies for individual-level geospatial data analysis using generalized additive models and relevant generalizations, with application in spatial epidemiology studies. With great honor, here I name my academic advisor, Professor <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dgillen/" target="_blank">Daniel Gillen</a> and our collaborators, <a href= "http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5993" target="_blank">Professor Veronica Viera</a> and <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5377" target="_blank">Professor Scott Bartel</a>. </p>
      <p>Since 2020, I have been working as a statistical scientist at Genentech, where I support late phase clinical trials in molecule development for ophthalmology disease treatment. </p>
